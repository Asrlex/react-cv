  description: [
    `I am an enthusiastic, motivated, and very dedicated person to my professional environment. The experience of working in a team since the beginning of my professional career has helped me develop a team culture focused on the collaborative progress of projects and tasks. My main areas of knowledge are Node.js, DB Management, Python, and Java, with basic knowledge of .NET and C.`,
    `My curiosity helps me maintain a constant learning process. I have a lot of interest in technology in general and how it evolves, mainly in development and AI. The evolution of AI models ethics-wise, learning how to safely implement these solutions in our current pipelines without disrupting the essence of what's being created or harming its users or the environment is a topic I find very relevant in the current technological zeitgeist.`,
    `I also carry this learning into expanding my development knowledge. Through courses, tutorials, and reviewing documentation from other projects, I am learning about complementary technologies to the environments I work in. In the last year, I have learned about Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform, as well as implementing CI/CD pipelines. I have also learned about implementing unit and integration tests in my projects.`,
    `This curiosity also extends to the language field. Since childhood, I have studied English to achieve bilingualism, with a C2 level. In recent years, I have learned German, reaching a B2 level with a B2-Mittelstufe title. Additionally, I have been able to navigate native environments of these languages by living in Canada and Germany for several months. As a complement, I have a B1 title in French and am learning some Italian.`,
